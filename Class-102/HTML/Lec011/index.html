        The city, best known as the location
        of the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, or the shrines of Imam
        Husayn and Abbas,[8][9] is considered a holy city for Shi'ite Muslims, in the same
        way as Mecca,

        Medina and Jerusalem. Tens of millions of Shi'ite
        Muslims visit the site twice a year, rivaling Mecca and Mashhad
        by the number of pilgrims annually.[10][11][12][13] The martyrdom
        of Husayn ibn Ali is commemorated annually by millions of Shi'ites.[14][15][16][17]
        Up to 8 million pilgrims visit the city to observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (the tenth day of the month o
        f Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn's death, but the main event is the A
        rbaʿīn (the 40th day after 'Ashura'), where up to 30 million visit the graves. Most of
        the pilgrims travel on foot from all around Iraq and more than 56 countries.[18]
