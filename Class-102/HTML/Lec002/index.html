            XForms is a World Wide Web Consortium 
            recommendation for creating web forms and web 
            applications.>It's easy to learn, provides a rich 
            user experience and does not require you to learn JavaScript.
            <hr>
            There are many different implementations of XF
            orms and this cookbook is designed to work with any of them. A list of implementations is available on the W3C website.
            
            This is a collaborative project and we encourage everyone who is using XForms to contribute their complete working XForms examples. All submissions must be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license.
            
            Note: many of the examples in this wikibook still use the "nodeset" attribute for binding rules, groups and repeats. Most XForms systems (Orbeon and betterForm) now use the "ref" attribute and may no longer support the older "nodeset" attributes. XSLTForms 1.0RC does not allow @ref instead of @nodeset but builds since rev.559 do support @ref where @nodeset was previously used. We will be updating the examples accordingly.
